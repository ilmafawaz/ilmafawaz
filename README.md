Hi, I'm Ilma 

On a journey into Data Analysis, Data Science & AI| Experimenting with ML, data projects and visualisations | Sharing as I learn

Welcome to my GitHub! This is where I explore AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science through hands-on projects.
I believe in learning by doing â€” every repo here reflects experiments, case studies, and practical applications of AI & ML and Data analysis.
