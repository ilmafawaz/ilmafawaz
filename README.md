Hi, I'm Ilma 👋

On a journey into AI & Data Science | Experimenting with prompts, ML, and data projects | Sharing as I learn

Welcome to my GitHub! This is where I explore AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science through hands-on projects.
I believe in learning by doing — every repo here reflects experiments, case studies, and practical applications of AI & ML.

🔑 Skills & Interests

Prompt Engineering: instruction prompts, few-shot learning, chaining, role-based AI interactions
Data Analytics + AI/ML: cleaning, summarization, SQL query generation, automated reporting
Machine Learning (ML): basics of supervised/unsupervised learning, model training, evaluation
AI Tools: OpenAI API, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Blynk (IoT + AI integration)
Creative AI: generating text, visuals, and business content with AI assistance
